					<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
					<p> I'm Viona. a first year at UCSC or UC Santa Cruz. I'm majoring in Computer Science and Game Design and I am addicted to playing games in my free time. I play games like VALORANT and League of Legends. I also do dragon boat in my free time on the weekends. I attempt to gym a few times a week to stay in shape but that doesn't work out too great all of the time. </p>
					<h3> INTERESTS </h3>
					<p2>I like to play video games of all sorts. I also collect key chains and stickers along with pins sometimes. I spend unhealthy amounts of money on rings and Smiskis as well as random trinkets that are cute.</p2>
