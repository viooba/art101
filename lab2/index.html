					<p>I'm Viona.. and I'm horrible at HTML and am suffering due to my lack of knowledge. This class is somehow harder than CSE20 which is odd to me but I think it will be worth it. I like wearing all black and gaming, not together or at the same time or anything. I play VALORANT and League of Legends which most people would find cringe or alarming. I'm currently yawning as I type this because I have a skewed sleep schedule and I either get no sleep at all or too much sleep because my mental health decides to fluctuate at times hence why my assignments are often late for classes. I buy a ring every time I go through something and I started doing this the first time I got into Santa Cruz which was this year since I'm a first year. I currently have about 15 rings in counting so I think that says a lot about me. </p>
