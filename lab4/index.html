			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge was to write pseudocode for a computer game that would later be turned into comments. We were also instructed to add our lists and indent as needed in the index.html as well as the lab.js to include our pseudocode turned into comments to make space for the java code.</p>
